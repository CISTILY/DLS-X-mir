This repository contains the implementations and experiments reported in our paper.

[Medical Image Retrieval via Nearest Neighbor Search on Pre-trained Image Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02401)

We have provided a separate implementation for [Medial Image Feature Extraction](https://github.com/deepaknlp/DLS/tree/main/ImageFeatureExtractors) and [Nearest Neighbor Search](https://github.com/deepaknlp/DLS/tree/main/SearchAndIndexingJavaCode).
