This repository contains the implementations and experiments reported in our paper.

[Medical Image Retrieval via Nearest Neighbor Search on Pre-trained Image Features](https://arxiv.org/pdf/xxxx.xxxxx.pdf)

We have provided a separate implementation for [Medial Image Feature Extraction](https://github.com/deepaknlp/DLS/tree/main/ImageFeatureExtractors) and [Indexing and NNS](https://github.com/deepaknlp/DLS/tree/main/SearchAndIndexingJavaCode).
